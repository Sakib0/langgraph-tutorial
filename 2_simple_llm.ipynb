      "Okay, the user asked for 5 interesting facts about football. Let me start by recalling some unique tidbits that aren't common knowledge. The first thing that comes to mind is the origin of the forward pass. Most people don't know it was illegal until 1906. That's a big change in how the game evolved. I should mention the St. Louis vs. Carroll College game where it was first used.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Next, I remember the Chicago Bears and their name change. They started as the Decatur Staleys. George Halas moved them to Chicago and renamed them after the Cubs. That's a fun connection to baseball. Maybe the user would find the business angle interesting—how teams rebrand after relocating.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Then there's the Super Bowl coin toss. The NFC team calls it, but the coin itself is special. The fact that the same official has done it for decades adds a cool human element. People love behind-the-scenes stuff like that.  \n",
      "\n",
      "The fourth fact—Tom Brady being drafted 199th. That's such an underdog story. It shows how unpredictable drafts can be. Highlighting his six Super Bowl wins emphasizes the irony. Users might enjoy the contrast between his draft position and success.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Lastly, the NFL's no-kicking rule for extra points in sudden death. It's obscure but fascinating. The \"Fair Play Game\" between the Steelers and Lions is a perfect example. The user might appreciate the strategic twist and how rules can lead to unexpected moments.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Now, considering the user's deeper needs. They probably want to impress others with lesser-known facts or spark conversation. Maybe they're a football fan looking for trivia, or a newcomer curious about the sport's quirks. Either way, these facts cover history, strategy, and culture to cater to different interests. I should present them clearly with engaging details to keep it fun and informative.\n",

      "Here are 5 interesting facts about American Football:\n",
      "\n",
      "1.  **The Forward Pass Was Once Illegal:** For the first several decades of football, the forward pass was completely illegal! The game was primarily a brutal ground-based rushing contest. The forward pass was legalized in **1906** as a safety measure to open up the game and reduce the constant, dangerous pile-ups. The first legal forward pass in a college game is credited to Bradbury Robinson of Saint Louis University against Carroll College on September 5, 1906.\n",
      "2.  **The Chicago Bears Weren't Always \"Bears\":** One of the NFL's oldest franchises, the Chicago Bears, started out in Decatur, Illinois, in **1919** as the **Decatur Staleys**, sponsored by the A.E. Staley food starch company. In 1921, player-coach George Halas moved the team to Chicago and kept the Staleys name for a year. They became the **Chicago Bears** in 1922, choosing the name partly to reflect their city's baseball team (the Cubs) and to evoke the idea of being larger and more powerful than baseball players.\n",
      "3.  **The Super Bowl Coin Toss Has a Dedicated Official:** The coin used for the Super Bowl coin toss is a specially minted commemorative coin. More interestingly, the NFL has had an official coin toss **\"flipper\"** for decades: referee **Art McNally** performed the duty for many years, followed by his son-in-law, **Phil Luckett**, and then **Jim Porter** (current NFL referee). The visiting team (NFC team in odd-numbered Super Bowls, AFC in even-numbered) *always* gets to call the toss.\n",
      "4.  **Tom Brady Was a 6th Round Draft Pick (199th Overall):** Arguably the greatest quarterback of all time, Tom Brady, was famously overlooked in the **2000 NFL Draft**. He wasn't selected until the 6th round as the 199th overall pick by the New England Patriots. This incredible draft-day slide stands in stark contrast to his record-setting career, which includes 7 Super Bowl wins (more than any *franchise*) and numerous individual accolades.\n",
      "5.  **A Game Was Once Decided by an Extra Point... Without a Kick:** In a bizarre rule quirk that no longer exists, during the first sudden-death overtime period, a team could *not* score a point via\n"
